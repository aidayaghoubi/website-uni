                    Neither did this professional pivot stop the release of
                    the Air Jordan IX. His status as an international icon inspired

                    After three consecutive years as the league's
                    champion, MJ left the hardwood — his first of
                    three total retirements. But his hiatus from one

                    single season in the minor leagues.
